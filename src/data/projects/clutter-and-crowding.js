    {type: "text", value: "In cluttered natural visual environments, object recognition capacity can be \
    severely limited. Human psychophysical studies have explored this issue in detail \
    and have demonstrated that diminished object recognition in clutter, referred to as \
    \"crowding\", worsens with distance from the fovea and can be profound in children \
    diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Recognition capacity limits may be a simple \
    by-product of how visual stimuli are encoded along the successive stages of the \
    ventral visual pathway, or they could reflect the limited resolution of attentional \
    control and object decoding, which rely on interactions between visual and frontal \
    cortex. Using a systematic stimulus progression from isolated stimuli to cluttered \
    displays, and behavioral reports in animals, we are investigating how naturalistic \
    displays are encoded, how encoding varies as a function of eccentricity and how \
    interactions between visual and frontal cortex limit object recognition capacity in clutter."}
