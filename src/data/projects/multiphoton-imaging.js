    "Working closely with our collaborators, Wyeth Bair (UW) and \
    Jack Waters (Allen Institute), we are implementing multiphoton \
    imaging in the awake macaque monkey. Multi-photon imaging allows \
    the simultaneous study of structure and function in a localized \
    circuit. This method is critical for tracking neurons longitudinally \
    during learning and to reveal experience-induced plasticity in at the \
    single-neuron resolution.To implement this technique in the awake monkey \
    we are optimizing our imaging chamber design, viral expression and imaging parameters.",
