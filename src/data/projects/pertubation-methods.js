    "To investigate inter-areal communication we have developed a cortical \
    cooling probe, which when placed on superficial cortex, suppresses activity \
    in the underlying tissue. This process is quick and reversible. We are using \
    this probe in concert with dual-Neuropixels probe recordings, to study the \
    dynamical interactions between visual and frontal cortex during object recognition.",
