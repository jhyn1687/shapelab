    {type: "text", value: "This is a new direction for the lab. Most experiments in the lab use static visual \
    stimuli to characterize response properties of V4 neurons but recently we have \
    discovered sensitivity for long range motion in primate V4. When a stimulus makes \
    big jumps across the visual scene, it induces a strong motion percept that has been \
    studied for close to a hundred years by psychophysicists. But neurons in the dorsal \
    visual stream of the primate, critical for motion processing, are insensitive to this \
    motion and this has remained a conundrum. We recently demonstrated that neurons in V4 \
    exhibit robust long range apparent motion sensitivity. Our results reveal a key novel \
    distinction between the processing of surface motion and object motion and identify a \
    new cortical mechanism for motion processing in the ventral stream that is complementary \
    to the long established system in the dorsal stream. A manuscript based on these results \
    is currently under review (Bigelow et al., Dissociation in neuronal encoding of object \
    versus surface motion in the macaque ventral stream)."},
