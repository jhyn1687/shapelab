    "We constructed eight texture categories based on three dimensions \
    that influence human texture perception (coarse vs fine, directional \
    vs nondirectional, regular vs irregular), and selected 2-3 representative \
    textures for each category. Each texture was presented through a circular \
    aperture of two sizes and at four orientations at 45Â° increments, for a total \
    of 168 texture stimuli.",
    "The diameter of the large aperture texture stimuli was twice that of the \
    estimated RF. Small aperture texture condition was created by applying a RF \
    sized circular aperture to large aperture texture.",
