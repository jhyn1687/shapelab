    {text:"Two fully-funded postdoctoral positions are immediately available for a collaborative project funded by the Brain Initiative. The goal is to identify and study connected neurons in visual cortex, frontal cortex and the pulvinar as animals are engaged in perceptual behavior. The project provides the opportunity to learn and implement a variety of cutting-edge techniques including viral-based circuit tracing and optogenetic methods to identify connected neurons, multiphoton imaging, high-density electrode recordings and computational modeling. The proposed work is a collaborative endeavor across the labs of Anitha Pasupathy and Wyeth Bair (University of Washington), Farran Briggs (University of Rochester) and Anqi Wu (Georgia Tech). "},
    {text:"The Pasupathy and Bair labs are part of the Washington National Primate Research Center (WaNPRC) and have close collaborations with the Allen Brain Institute. Postdoctoral pay at the University of Washington will be in accordance with the Washington Minimum Wage Act. Candidates with a Ph.D. in the Biological Sciences or Engineering and an excellent research record are encouraged to apply. A strong background in relevant quantitative data analysis and modeling, and/or a strong background in primate or rodent neurophysiology or imaging would be a plus. Please send applications (short letter of interest, CV and the names and contact information of two referees), or request for additional information, to: Anitha Pasupathy."},
